I love classical music and I practice playing piano 40 hours a day. The Symphony No. 3 in D minor by Gustav Mahler is one of my favorites.

Thoughts on learning theory and AI research: 

The interplay between network model structures and data intrinsic structures, and the generalization and extrapolation behaviors of the neural networks --- this resembles how humans' scientific discoveries match the real physical world (i.e., epistemology), which has been investiaged by great philosophiers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason">Immanuel Kant</a>. The forms of human perception, knowledge, reasoning, and decision-making have
also been studied by fields outside computer science. My own research benefits a lot from knowledge and principles from other fields such as psychology, economy, theoretical physics, and philosophy.
