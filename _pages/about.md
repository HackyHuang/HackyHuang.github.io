I am Kaixuan Huang (黄凯旋), an incoming Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Princeton. I work closely with Prof. [Jason Lee](https://jasondlee88.github.io/). Before that, I received B.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University. I was advised by Prof. Zhihua Zhang while doing undergraduate research. In 2019, I visited Georgia Tech as a research intern, supervised by Prof. [Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/). In 2020, I visited Tsinghua University as a research intern, supervised by Prof. [Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/).

I am broadly interested in theoretical aspects of machine learning and data science, including deep learning theory, optimization, reinforcement learning, etc. I aim at developing theories that provide guidences for devising practical machine learning models, algorithms and methodologies. I also enjoy developing practical algorithms and tools.

I am open to possible cooperations or visiting opportunities. If you are interested, please contact me by email or [wechat](../files/wechat.jpg).
